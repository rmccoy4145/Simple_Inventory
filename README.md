# Simple_Inventory

***!!Old Project Alert!!***

This project is a simple webapp for managing inventory for a company, it allows you to store asset info including serial number,bar code, vendor name, etc... and track those assets by room location. A simple grid layout is used for the UI to add, update, and remove assets.
